Project Structure
eval.py: Contains the EvalPolicy class that is responsible for simulating the environment and evaluating patient data based on reinforcement learning principles.
gemma.py: Houses the GEMMA class, which integrates the evaluation results from EvalPolicy to make diagnostic predictions. The class also includes functions to process cognition scores and generate a diagnosis severity.

Create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
TensorFlow Installation:

Ensure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using:

bash
pip install tensorflow
Garage Installation:

The project also uses the garage library for reinforcement learning. Install it as follows:

bash
pip install garage
Usage
Running the Simulation and Diagnosis
Prepare the Dataset: Ensure you have the MRI data in the correct format. The data should include initial values for patient conditions such as cognition (cog_init), amyloid levels (D), health metrics (X_V), and so on.

Edit and Load Data: Modify the data structure in gemma.py to load your patient data. Example format:

python
data = [
    np.random.rand(10),  # Example for X_V
    np.random.rand(10),  # Example for D
    np.random.rand(10),  # Example for alpha1
    np.random.rand(10),  # Example for alpha2
    np.random.rand(10),  # Example for beta
    np.random.rand(10),  # Example for cognition
    np.arange(10)        # Example for RIDs
]
Run the GEMMA System: After setting up the data, you can run gemma.py to evaluate the patient conditions and get a diagnosis:

bash
python gemma.py
This will output the cognition scores and diagnosis for each patient in the datase
